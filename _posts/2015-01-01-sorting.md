For this project I chose to visually represent different algorithms used to sort data (Insertion sort, Quick sort, and Selection sort) using <a href="https://www.processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>. In the image below, Iâ€™ve generated three visual sections by running three different sorting algorithms in parallel on the same set of data, and had the program signal to visualize each component swap that occurs between list elements within each algorithm. The video displays the sorting in real time, and the printed images are the output of running the program once.

Video coming soon.
