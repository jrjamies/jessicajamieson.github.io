For this open ended project for a Hybrid Digit Media Art course, I chose to visually represent different algorithms used to sort data (Insertion sort, Quick sort, and Selection sort) using <a href="https://www.processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>. In the image below, Iâ€™ve generated three visual sections by running three different sorting algorithms in parallel on the same set of data. I had the program visualize each component swap that occurs between list elements within each step of the algorithm. The video displays the sorting in real time, and the printed images are the output of running the program once.
