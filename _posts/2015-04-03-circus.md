This work explores the relationship between geometric shapes and abstraction. The representational portion as a standalone image is very geometric. I wanted to transform the tent to capture the experience of watching a Cirque du Soleil performance, without straying from the clean lines and primary colours. During a performance, the acrobats are in an almost constant state of interesting and mesmerizing movement, which I strove to abstractly represent with ribbons.

Created using Adobe Illustrator.
