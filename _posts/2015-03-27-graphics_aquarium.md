This project respresents my pride and joy of Fall 2014. After a large number of hardworking and sleepless hours, I present to you my aquarium:

This interactive OpenGL and C++ project was the final assignment for a Computer Graphics course at the University of Waterloo. We were required to implement 10 objectives, as well as consider everything we'd learned prior in the course. A few highlights for me were shader programming, bump mapping, particle systems, fractal terrain, and motion path animation.

Shader programming was great because I got to indulge my artsy side a little, and play around with the visuals. I implemented toon shading (pictured below), and added fog effects to the reflection in the glass for added realism. Particle systems were also fun because, well, <a href="http://media.giphy.com/media/LmY8STYyvCtiM/giphy.gif" target="_blank">bubbles</a>!

I also enjoyed  experimenting with computer generated fractals. The mountains pictured above are dynamically generated fractal terrain, and the plant is an few iterations of an L-system fractal. I've always been fascinated by fractals in nature, and have studied a more mathematical approach, so I was interested in emulating the visual complexity programatically.


I was recognized as the 3rd place winner in my class for this project. We were evaluated not only on the completion of our objectives, but also our code quality, documentation, and overall aesthetic.
