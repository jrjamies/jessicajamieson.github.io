__Note:__ I am currently in the process of populating this site with <br/>
content. For more, see <a href="http://jrjamieson.tumblr.com" target="_blank">my previous portfolio site</a>

----------------

I am a Computer Science student from the University of Waterloo, <br/>
with minors in Computational Mathematics and Fine Arts. 

I have a passion for all things graphics, a keen interest in <br/>
exploring the connections between art and technology. 

When I am not investigating the latest web technologies, you <br/>
can find me scaling a rock wall, experimenting with a new recipe, <br/>
or curled up with good book and a mug of chai tea.
