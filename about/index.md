I am currently a Technical Director at Walt Disney Animation Studios, with an educational<br/>
background in Computer Science, Computational Math, and Fine Arts<br/>
at the University of Waterloo.

I have a passion for all things graphics, a keen interest in exploring the<br/>
connections between art and technology.

In my spare time, you can find me<br/>
climbing a rock wall, exploring with my dog Luna, or curled up<br/>
with good book and a mug of chai tea.
