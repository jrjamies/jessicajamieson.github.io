I am currently a Technical Director at Walt Disney Animation Studios, with <br/>
an educational background in Computer Science, Computational Math, and Fine Arts<br/>
at the University of Waterloo.

I have a passion for all things graphics, a keen interest in exploring the<br/>
connections between art and technology.

In my spare time, you can find me climbing a rock wall, exploring with</br>
my dog Luna, or curled up with good book and a mug of chai tea.
