I am a soon-to-be graduate from Computer Science at the University<br/> 
of Waterloo, with minors in Computational Mathematics and Fine Arts. 

I have a passion for all things graphics, a keen interest in exploring the<br/>
connections between art and technology. 

When I am not investigating the latest technologies, you can find me<br/>
climbing a rock wall, experimenting with new recipes, or curled up<br/>
with good book and a mug of chai tea.
